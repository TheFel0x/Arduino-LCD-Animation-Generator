# Arduino LCD Animation Generator
 Takes frames and turns them into 20x16 pixel animation. Outputs.ino file for Arduino that has an LCD screen connected to it.

I ogiginally made this to play "Bad Apple!!" on an LCD display.

The Arduino UNO can have a maximum of 31 looping frames with this method.
